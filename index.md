# Intro to Markdown
This is an example file to practice using Markdown formatting. 

## Headers
You can create headers in Markdown by using "#", "##", up to "######" for each header level, along with a space, before whatever text you choose as a title. 

## Text Emphasis

- To make text **Bold**, use " ** " xyz " ** ".
- To make text _italicized_, use " _ " xyz " _ ".
- To quote text, use ">".

The changes I made to this file include formatting and adding text.

## Adding Images
To add images, copy and paste an image link into the following format: (![image](insert link here)

(![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc724f1c-adb6-4bfa-b24b-a2936acdb7ed)

## Code Blocks

#### How to Insert Sections of Code

Use the following format: a sandwich of 3 "`", or  "```" followed by the section of code, followed by another set.

(_aka the same key as the tilde "~"_)

It will look like this: 

```javascript
var myVar= "Hello, World!";
```
