# Intro to Markdown
This is an example file to practice using Markdown formatting. 

## Headers
You can create headers in Markdown by using "#", "##", up to "######" for each header level, along with a space, before whatever text you choose as a title. 

## Text Emphasis

- To make text **Bold**, use " ** " xyz " ** ".
- To make text _italicized_, use " _ " xyz " _ ".
- To quote text, use ">".

The changes I made to this file include formatting and adding text.
