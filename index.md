# Intro to Markdown
This is an example of basic formatting in Markdown. 

## Headers
You can create headers in Markdown by using "#", "##", up to "######" for each header level, along with a space, before whatever text you choose as a title. 

## Text Emphasis

- To make text **Bold**, use " ** " xyz " ** ".
- To make text _italicized_, use " _ " xyz " _ ".
- To quote text, use ">".

## Adding Images
To add images, copy and paste an image link into the following format: ![image](insert link here)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc724f1c-adb6-4bfa-b24b-a2936acdb7ed)

## Code Blocks

#### How to Insert Sections of Code

Use the following format: add a section of code in between a sandwich of "```"

(_aka the bottom character on the same key as the tilde "~"_)

It will look like this: 

```javascript
var myVar= "Hello, World!";
```

## Task Lists
#### Syntax
###### Checked Box
"- [x] "
###### Unchecked Box
"- [ ] "
#### Example
 - [x] completed task
 - [x] completed task
 - [ ] uncompleted task
